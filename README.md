First of all, this script is useless üòÅ

Yes, it is because you can find CCJ in many different places.

Telegram
Discord
Reddit

And the list goes on. You can check on their site. You find the links at the bottom of the page. 

That said, why did I write this script then? Simple. Hobby...

You can install Twillio and create a function to, IF word X appear, send you an alert. I have an example here:  https://github.com/CoinsOfPixel/btc2sms

I did not wrote this function because I really don't like SMS, I only use this service when it's really necessary (AKA the service doesn't have gAuth or any similar). 

You can also display the content from DB in a PHP page. Use your brain. 

You can change the entire script and use it for your own purposes and even on another site. Actually, you can do with this script whenever you want. 

Enjoy.
